This module adds a field for a default quantity to Unit of Measure Categories.
When this is filled in, and when this functionality is enabled in the Point of
Sale configuration, then adding that product to an order in the Point of Sale
will set the quantity to that value by default.

Use Cases / Context
===================

This is an old module of which the original intention is lost to time. It is
used by supermarkets. They use it on weighted products by setting a very high
default minimal amount. This prevents the cashier from forgetting to put a
weight on the product (because the total of the order is then very high if the
weight is not manually set).

Configuration
=============

In order to set this up, you need to do a few things:

- Make sure that you have permissions to manage multiple units of measure.
- In the settings of Inventory, enable units of measure.
- For each relevant unit of measure category, determine a default product quantity
  (default: 1).
- For each relevant Point of Sale, find 'Set default product quantity' in the
  'Inventory' section of its settings, and toggle it on.
